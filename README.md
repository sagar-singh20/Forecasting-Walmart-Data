# Forecasting-Walmart-Data

## Abstract
E-commerce is a huge part of the economy and is vital to businesses that sell their products or services online. Sales fore- casting is the process of estimating future revenue by predicting the amount of product or services a sales unit will sell in the next iteration. This is vital to e-commerce giants and may help increase large chunks of revenue. In this project, we use hierar- chical sales data from Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days.

## Introduction
Ecommerce has been an ever-growing industry with retail revenues projected to grow to 4.9 trillion US dollars in 2021. With this tremendous growth, sales forecasts will help businesses understand changing customer demands, manage inventories as per the demands thus reducing the financial risks, and create a pricing strategy that reflects demand. Companies will be able to take strategic steps on their short - term and long - term perfor- mances and can decide their decision metrics. This project will present the right methodologies to analyze time-series sales data and predict 28 days ahead point forecasts for the company to take strategic decisions based on the predictions.

## Dataset
We have collected Walmart Sales Forecasring Dataset from M5 Forecasting Data Competition. The dataset contains 5 year historical sales from 2011- 2016 for various products and stores. Data is hierarchically organized: stores are divided into 3 states, and products are grouped by categories and sub-categories. 

Furthermore, the dataset is organized in 3 CSV files :
 - calendar.csv - Contains dates on which the products are sold and events held on that day.
 - Sales_train_evaluation.csv: Contains historical daily unit sales of each product on each store
 - Sell_prices.csv: price of products each week
